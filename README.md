# Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

Once you have cloned/downloaded [this repository](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge), follow the steps below to run the individual scripts and examine the results for each of the four python challenges.

## PyBank
* **Main Python Script**: [main.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBank/main.py)
* **Python Module**: [pybank.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBank/pybank.py) - This module contains functions to analyze the bank data and print+export the results to a text file in the same folder.
* To run the script, navigate to the *PyBank* folder on you local machine and run: `python main.py` 
* The script analyzes the [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBank/budget_data.csv) file and prints the results to terminal as well as exports the results to the output file: [pybank_output.txt](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBank/pybank_output.txt).
## PyPoll
* **Main Python Script**: [main.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/main.py)
* **Python Module**: [pypoll.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/pypoll.py) - This module contains functions to analyze the election voting data, print the election results to terminal and export them to a text file in the same folder.
* To run the script, navigate to the *PyPoll* folder on you local machine and run: `python main.py` 
* The script analyzes the [election_data.csv](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/election_data.csv) file and prints the results to terminal as well as exports the results to the output file: [pypoll_output.txt](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/pypoll_output.txt).
## PyBoss
* **Main Python Script**: [main.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBoss/main.py)
* **Python Module**: [pyboss.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBoss/pyboss.py) - This module contains functions to convert employee data records in a csv file to the required format. The converted dataset is exported to a new csv file in the same folder.
* To run the script, navigate to the *PyBoss* folder on you local machine and run: `python main.py` 
* The script analyzes the [employee_data.csv](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBoss/employee_data.csv) file and exports the converted dataset to the file: [pyboss_output.csv](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBoss/pyboss_output.csv). The terminal will print a message indicating the analysis and conversion of the file.

## PyParagraph
* **Main Python Script**: [main.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyParagraph/main.py)
* **Python Module**: [pyparagraph.py](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyParagraph/pyparagraph.py) - This module contains functions to analyze passages/paragraphs within a text file and produce a simple set of metrics to determine the complexity of the passages.
* To run the script, navigate to the *PyParagraph* folder on you local machine and run: `python main.py` 
* The script analyzes three text files, namely: [paragraph_1.txt](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyParagraph/paragraph_1.txt), [paragraph_2.txt](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyParagraph/paragraph_2.txt) and [paragraph_3.txt](https://github.com/anulkar/python-challenge/blob/master/PyParagraph/paragraph_3.txt), and prints the metrics for each file successively to the terminal.
